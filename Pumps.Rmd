Loading the datasets into a statistical programming language. In this case we are using R programming language. 

R version 3.4.1 (2017-06-30)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
Running under: Windows >= 8 x64 (build 9200)

We are using R Studio as an IDE for R. All the packages attached are listed with the code

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

setwd("D:/UIC/MyResearch")



library(readxl)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

```

**Attaching f in prefix because loading the name in dataset**

```{r}

for(i in 1:length(excel_sheets(path))){

}
# drop a column

Let's identify the equipments notifn

Z1 category is preventice maintenance. Thus we see that if a pump is maintained preventively chances are
less of it getting corrupted

It is assumed that installation date of every pump is to be considered the previous year's date in April

4 dates were formatted in excel itself before loading. Their format was changed from 
%m/%d/y and %m.%d.y

We will arrange the dates in <span color="green">descending order </span> ( in the order in which they are listed ) and then group them according to the <span color="green">notification type </span>



```{r}

Kirlosker$Notif.date<-lubridate::dmy(Kirlosker$Notif.date)

KSB$Notif.date<-lubridate::dmy(KSB$Notif.date)


```



After converting all the dates in a common format, we will 

Analyzing the Kirlosker dataset first

###### We know that start date of any pump is the previous year and april 1 which would be 



```{r}

dates_from_subtd<-Kirlosker %>% group_by(Equipment) %>% summarise(Date=min(Notif.date))

#For every pump we got the min date and hence subtracting one year from the date we can get our date for analysis 


date_installed<-as.data.frame(paste((lubridate::year(dates_from_subtd$Date)-1),"04-01",sep="-"))
colnames(date_installed)<-"Date Installed"

dates_from_subtd<-cbind(dates_from_subtd,date_installed)
rm(date_installed)

dates_from_subtd<-dates_from_subtd[,c(1,3)]


Kirlosker<-left_join(Kirlosker,dates_from_subtd)

rm(dates_from_subtd)

dates_from_subtd<-Kirlosker %>% select(Equipment,Notif.date,`Date Installed`)  

dates_from_subtd$`Date Installed`<-as.Date(dates_from_subtd$`Date Installed`)

dates_from_subtd<-dates_from_subtd %>% mutate(diff_date=(Notif.date - `Date Installed`))

dates_from_subtd %>% group_by(Equipment) %>% summarise(Date=min(diff_date))


```

The above table gives us the the days between which the pump had fault for the first time 

**Can use %in% operator to selectively filter some of the values **

```{r}

Kirlosker<-Kirlosker %>% select(`Notifictn type`,Equipment,Notif.date,`Date Installed`)

We need to manually put the dates which are set to zero because it has to be subtracted from the data installed 

**Although we can easily replace it with few rows I want to write code which is generic** 
For this we have to know how many rows each category has and will then replace them will the last one because they are the ones which are zero or NA 

```{r}

insertionM<-(Kirlosker %>% group_by(Equipment) %>% tally())

# We get the count of each equipment and we know that last we have to calculate manually

# Now wherever there are zeroes we can replace them with the date installed subtracted from the first fault occurence

Kirlosker$`Date Installed`<-as.Date(Kirlosker$`Date Installed`)

for(i in 1:nrow(Kirlosker)){
